//! Debounce algorithm implementation.
/*!
    An implementation of cactusjack's
    [Elegant debouncing solution with software Schmitt trigger emulation](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=125297),
    with a few tweaks. 
 
    The tweaks to cactusjack's algorithm are:
    - I use two sucessive 7-bit filters. This seems to work better than one alone. It creates a 
      delay in sensing a state change (the inevitable tradeoff of smoothing the input), but for 
      manually operated buttons the delay is not excessive.
    - When the output state changes, I saturate the filters to the new value. This,
      hopefully, provides better supression of bouncing in particular
    - I feed back the previous state into the second filter. The real reason for this
      is an artifact of the underlying numbers: (0xff>>1)+(0xff>>2)+(0xff>>2) is 0xFD, not 0xFF.
    - I use two of the bits in the 16-bit word to store state. This means that sizeof(DebounceFilter)
      is just the two bytes for the filter. and one byte to manage the time-based sampling.
    - The rate limiting sample is farmed out to a subclass
 
    In normal use, you pass a DebounceFilter a series of samples
    via the addSample method, and read the debounced result with state(). convenience method stateChanged()
    indicates that the most recent sample caused the state to change.
